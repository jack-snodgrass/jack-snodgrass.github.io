    <h1>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>That I am definitely a visual learner and just reading notes doesn’t cut it for a lot of things.</li>
        <li>I was not well versed in problem solving techniques and needed to find new ways to tackle challenges </li>
        <li>That I had a very fixed mindset going into foundations and believed I was limited by my IQ</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h1>
    <p>
        The world of programming is such a vast and major sector that has new people entering it every day. With such a large and collaborative work force it is going to 
        be impossible to not have interactions with other programmers so being able to embody these are going to be crucial for not only getting jobs but being able to work 
        in a. Team successfully. 
    </p>

    <h1>what has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
    <p>
        The two activities that were entered around growth mindset and problem solving. I found I had a a very fixed mindset and that I was using the same one or two methods 
        to try and solve every problem I was facing. So being able to do some research into having a growth mindset and some new problem solving techniques was super beneficial. 
    </p>

    <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
    <p>
        The reflections at the end of each challenge. Was hard for me to not write it just for the people who have been through the same challenges and understand what we 
        were doing but do write it so it could cater to a non technical audience. I had to get my flatmates to read some of it and when it made no sense I really had to sit 
        back and think about how to re write it 
    </p>

    <h1>why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h1>
    <p>
        Because having technical skills only gets you so far in the development world, especially when it comes to getting jobs. You also need to have a large bank of human 
        skills as this is such collaborative industry and you need to know how to efficiently work inside of a team. 
    </p>

    <h1>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h1>
    <p>
        Not at all. Even though it’s a course for web development I would not have been able to complete a lot of the tasks without the core primers and challenges that we went through.
         Without the problem solving section I would of been lost and had a hard time finishing a lot of the tech challenges.
    </p>

    <h1>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h1>
    <p>
        To work with some big name clients and progress into building apps as well as creating websites. And to eventually have enough experience to work for myself and contract out 
        or even start my own company. 
    </p>

    <h1>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h1>
    <p>
        The two big human skills I would like to work on is communication and growth-mindset. I want to work on my communication skills so I can work effectively in a team so things
         don’t get distorted and confusing for everyone. The key to good communicating is also strong listening skills. It's important to hear what people are saying to you so I want 
         to work on this as well. And growth mindset is another skill I would like to work on as this industry never stops growing or changing, this will help me stay focused on becoming
         a better person and increasing my knowledge personally and professionally.
    </p>

    <h1>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h1>
    <p>
        I will need to work on being outspoken and letting my voice be heard. I can be quite shy and could very easily fade into the background and become a spectator for group projects. 

        My strengths will be that I’m very respectful not only to people but to processes and this will help me attack and complete challenges efficiently and in a good manner. 
    </p>

    <h1>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h1>
    <p>
        As stated above its about speaking up and letting my voice be heard so I’m involved completely. I also will keep in mind this all such new experience and I’m coming into this with 
        no prior knowledge how to do anything so need to not be afraid to reach out to my peers and teachers when I get stuck or confused by a project.
