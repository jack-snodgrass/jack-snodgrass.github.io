    <h3>My long term and career goals??
    </h3>
    <p>
      After spending 2 years working in a web and software team as the test analyst I knew that I wanted to enter the world of development for sure. Post EDA I would like to work in a large development team and head up and be the product owner for a large scale project, I’ve worked as a scrum master before and it is an amazing way to elevate your human skills, so next step is to be fully in charge of a project. Long term goals I have is once I have built up a large enough portfolio of work and skills to either contract myself out and be my own boss, or even start my own company for something I’m passionate about in this sector. 
   </p>
   
   <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
   <p>
    The two big human skills I would like to work on is communication and growth-mindset. I want to work on my communication skills so I can work effectively in a team so things don’t get distorted and confusing for everyone. The key to good communicating is also strong listening skills. It's important to hear what people are saying to you so I want to work on this as well. And growth mindset is another skill I would like to work on as this industry never stops growing or changing, this will help me stay focused on becoming a better person and increasing my knowledge personally and professionally.
  </p>
    
  <h3>Strengths and Limitations</h3>
  <p>
    As stated in my cultural 1 blog my strengths that will help me through this course is compassion and respect. This will help me work effectively in a team and to take on constructive criticism and advice. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Also as stated in my cultural 1 blog my limitations that I will need to put a lot of work on is to be trusting, not to only my fellow peers but also to myself. This will help with my biggest limitation which is having a low residence to failure and challenges which can make me become very self-deprecating and hinder my ability to do my best work possible. 
 </p>

 <h3>How I would seek for help in a timely way?</h3>
 <p> 
  The big challenge for me is not around how I would seek help but when to realise that I actually need help and can’t do something by myself, and truly admit that. I would exhaust all options by myself, but once I realise I need help I’ll reach out to my fellow cohorts and facilitator over slack and in person. 
 </p>


 <h3>What do I expect from the facilitation team?</h3>
 <p>
  Apart from help and support throughout the course, especially for foundations when we are all at home, the big one for me is honesty. I want to work on taking constructive criticism so Im hoping the facilitators tell me when something isn’t working or I need to re evaluate my work or approach.
