    <h3>Situation where I had to make a ethical decision:</h3>
    <p>
      I boarded at high school for the last 2 years I was there. I had many of my friends up in there with me. One year I found out that one of my roommates had been stealing off one of the younger kids and planned to sell what he had stolen for his own gain. The ethical decision I faced from this was wether or not to come forward and let the staff know what was happening and risk losing a friend over doing the right thing or stay silent and have to not only live with both of them still but having made the wrong decision. In the end I gave my friend and ultimatum that he had to give it back by the end of the day or ill  inform the staff. So in the end it was the choice to stay true to my personal values and not let personal relationships change who I was.

    <h3>What are my strenghts that will help me on this journey?</h3>
    <p>
     I think through the experiences I have gone through in life this has helped shape my best and worst core values. The best being that I have learnt how to be very compassionate for the people around me. Im not one who enjoys or flourishes when alone and have shaped myself to be someone that people are always happy to approach and want to get to know. I don’t view my popularity and how many friends I have as a measure of this, but more how deep and personal the few I do have are. This has been a very helpful skill to have as it has helped me create a very personal, ethical and open-minded view of the world. Compassion helps me to be socially aware and helps drive me to fight for equity and equality in the world I live in. And through this I found one of my biggest strengths has been the ability to work within any team I have been placed in. I flourish on projects where I am involved or directly working with another person , and this is when I get the best version and results out of myself. Not to say I can’t work alone but Ive found that human connection helps every other factor in life run a little smoother.

  <h3>What are some of my weaknesses or limitations I'll run into over this Journey?</h3>
  <p>
    Its not all good though, no ones perfect so there are definitely things that I want to improve on. I have limitations and certain traits that could not only hinder my ability to make connections with people, but to function as a good human being. I like to think I have a big heart and I know I can come across as trusting on the surface but life circumstances and situations over the years have hurt this heart deeply so I think underneath I can still be very untrusting due to the way I’ve been treated over time and this is why sometimes I can act out in the forms of anger and cutting contact with people who love me – as a way of protecting myself.  I think I can be my own worst enemy and think that because of the way others have treated me over time that I’m not worthy and therefore become extremely self-depreciative and I need to build resilience, so rather than believing the worst, or focusing on the wrong opinions, I focus on who I AM and what I’m capable of.
