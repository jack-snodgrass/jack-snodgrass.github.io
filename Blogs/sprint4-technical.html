        <h1>What is neuroplascity???</h1>
        <p>
            Have you ever heard the term brain plasticity? Is this the scientific term for our brains being made of plastic? Surely they can’t be the 
            same material as a water bottle Right? Well that is not what I’m saying here at all. This is the term we use to describe how through all of our 
            different experiences and feelings the effect that it can have on the human brain. When we learn new things or take time to fully memorise a 
            certain skill or technique actual functional changes happen in our brains pathways that can be long lasting. This is called neuroplascity. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Neuroplascity is very important and can be super beneficial to everyone as it allows us to rewire and repair our brains to always be learning 
            and growing as people. It is at the base of all our human experiences and I think it is crucial to understand this and know how to improve your own 
            brain health with this practice. I don’t have the best memory in the world, you could almost call it terrible to be honest, so I want to use this idea 
            to try and get this part of my brain firing. I think repetition and constant practice will help with this especially in the sense of programming where 
            we will be using the same skill sets for different challenges and needing to tap into that [art of the brain. 
        </p>

            After reading through this <a url="(https://thriveglobal.com/stories/how-to-improve-your-neuroplasticity">article</a> I realised the two biggest ways 
            ill incorporate this idea, and have been slacking, is to get enough quality sleep and find a strong purpose and some motivation for what I am trying to learn. 
            Getting enough sleep allows the brains pathways to reset and prepare for the next days activities while strengthening the existing ones. And finding a purpose 
            makes your brain more active and alert so you will approach the tasks at hand with more intent and focus which has been proven to enhance a persons neuroplascity.

        <h1>What is growth mindset?</h1>
        <p>
            When talking about a persons mindset it relates to how we our beliefs and how perceive our base intelligence and ability to learn and complete tasks and 
            challenges set forward to us. When trying to put a term to it two categories and ways of viewing a persons mindset come into play,  <strong>Fixed</strong> and <strong>Growth</strong> A person
             with a fixed mindset believes that their traits and skills, as well as their intelligence, is at a fixed rate and can’t change over time, leading them to become 
             very self deprecating and harsh on themselves when dealing with challenges and failure believing they don’t have what it takes. Where as a person with a growth 
             mindset views their personalities and traits as being able to be developed and grown over time and with their experiences. When people believe they can become 
             smarter and expand their intelligence realise that their effort has a direct effect on wha they can achieve so they will take a harder approach which ultimately 
             leads to higher achievement. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Carol Dweck who did the initial research into growth mindset believes that is an important skill to have if you want to be successful in life. Some of the points 
            she makes up really caught my attention and made me realise I have had a very fixed mindset over the last few years and my approach to a lot of things needs work. 
            Acknowledging and embracing your weaknesses and being able to work on them and tackle them head on. And another big one is to prioritise learning over seeking 
            approval. To often in the past I’ve been worried about how people view me or the work I’m doing without focusing on how I feel about it. I think switching focus to
             thus will help me put out more work that I’m proud of and happy to call my own.
