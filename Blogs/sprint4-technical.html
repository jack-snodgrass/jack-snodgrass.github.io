        <h1>The Easy issue:</h1>
        <p>
            I was very blocked at the midway point in the fizzbuzz challenge. I went straight into writing my code without really looking at the challenge 
            or what the tests were. My new code kept causing the old ones to fail and was getting confusing.
 
        </p>
        <h3>The methods I used to get through it:</h3>
        <p>
            I went back and copied and pasted what I had already out down into a different document and then fully erased the code on repl to start from scratch. 
            I then used pseudo code while reading over the tests scripts to write out the steps of what I actually needed to complete to pass them. Then using google 
            and a lot of forums form places like stackoverflow to either ask questions or look over existing ones where people have had other problems similar to mine. 
            I was then able to break it down into smaller steps and complete it.
        </p>
        <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
        <p>
            I started off confused and frustrated for sure but after writing the pseudo code and actually observing not just the error logs but the tests code themselves 
            it was easy to stay calm and break down the challenge and attack it one step at a time. It really made me feel confident about solving problems due to the share 
            amount fo resources that are our there for use to use to find answers we might need for any problems we face.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>The elegant way:</h1>
        <p>
            When doing the final Kata challenge I found it difficult from the get go when facing things such as mapping that I was completely unfamiliar with and wasn’t 
            getting it to work even after going at it for a few hours.
        </p>
        <h3>The methods I used to get through it:</h3>
        <p>
            Google!Google!Google! I read so many articles and forums over google before even attempting to come back into it. Once I thought I understood a little better 
            I wrote out pseudo code to a greater extent then in the previous challenges to break it down. I then used the rubber ducky method as I went along to make sure 
            I could explain what I was doing and to not move onto the next challenge until I could. I found that I could explain it a lot better than previously. It may have 
            caused me to spend a little more time on it then I had wanted but it was worth it because by vocalising it using the rubber ducky I could feel myself getting more 
            confident and starting to put things together in my head. 
        </p>

        <h2>What did I learn:</h2>
        <p>
            The biggest things I learned through these two problems was how helpful pseudo code can be to visualise what you need to do better, and that breaking the parent 
            problem into smaller children issues using this method makes it a lot easier to see where you are getting confused or blocked. After finishing I went back to the 
            “getting micro” section of the pre foundation curriculum and took some good notes down that will help with this also.
